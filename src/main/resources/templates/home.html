        <h3>Welcome to YAET!</h3>
        <p>This site is born from the mix of a personal necessity and curiosity.</p>
        <p>I am a software developer that was looking to learn the ins and outs of the trade in a nonwork environment. I wanted to be able to test, play and tweak with the tools of the trade without the pressures and requirements that come when developing for a client.</p>
        <p>I was also looking for a tool to help me manage my finances. I had used some pay tools in the past, but I refused to pay for a glorified excel spreadsheet*. At the same time, the tools that I found online were not to my liking.</p>
        <p>So in the end I decided to kill two birds with one stone and this is the result!</p>
